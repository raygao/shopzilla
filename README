== Shopzilla
shopzilla is a demo prepared for Dreamforce 2010 conference.

== Getting Started
run following:
1. sudo rake gems:install
2. update the rforce gem, there is a bug inside. Need to change the 'DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE'
to 2000. Otherwise, it will be too small. By default it is set at 200. And, 2000
is the max. Don't go above that, or you will get an error.
See below (Rforce/binding.rb)


module RForce
  # Implements the connection to the SalesForce server.
  class Binding
    include RForce

    # Increase the maximum fetch size to 2000, as allowed by Salesforce
    # Added by Raymond Gao
    DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE = 2000


== TO DO
Coordinate with the author to fix this bug in the Rforce GEM.
Additonally, need to update my GEM (asf-soap-adapter) the 'Salesforce::SfBase' file.
Because, if we have lots of results, need to use queryLocator to get additional rows.
The todo is following:

    def self.query_by_sql(sql)
      query_results = connection.binding.query :searchString => sql
      return query_results.queryResponse.result.records unless query_results.queryResponse.result.size < 1
    end
